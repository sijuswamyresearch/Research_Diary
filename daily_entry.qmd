# End of First Semester

## Courses Completed
- **24MA604 Computational Mathematics for Data Science**
- **24DS601 Machine Learning**
- **24RM801 Research Methodology for Engineering**

### Reflections on the Semester
It has been a challenging yet enriching semester, where I gained a strong foundation in Computational Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Research Methodology. Some key takeaways include:

- **Computational Mathematics**: Developed a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts crucial for data science, including stochastic models and optimization techniques.
- **Machine Learning**: Learned about various machine learning algorithms, their applications, and the importance of data preprocessing.
- **Research Methodology**: Gained insights into the research process, including methodology, paper writing, and presentation skills.

### Final Presentations and Viva-Voce
The semester ended with course viva-voce, project presentations, and final exams. I presented my work on [Computational Linear Algebra](https://sijuswamy.github.io/ks_siju_CB.AI.R4CEN24003_Computational-Mathematics-for-DataScience/), where I demonstrated the progress and insights from the semester.
